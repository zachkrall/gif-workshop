# GIFs, what even are they

A .gif file is used for bitmap images (or images built around pixels). While this file type has a significantly smaller color space, it supports animation which draws the most appeal for its use. [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF)]

## Why would we want to use them?

GIFs original were a great way for special content or navigation on a website to have some added flair and be more visible beyond boring hyperlinks. If you don't remember, [take a look at the (still live) website for the movie Space Jam](https://www.warnerbros.com/archive/spacejam/movie/jam.htm).

The flexibility of the GIF to move around the internet without needed to be embeded (like video files).
 
## Reaction GIFs

A lot of messaging apps and digital communication involes *reaction GIFs*. They can be interpretted [a stand in for body language](https://daily.jstor.org/the-morphology-of-reaction-gifs/) that could drastically change the way a message is received. There is still a very constant and face paced way that this format of communicating is evolving, but [some museums are doing their best to put them into a historical context](https://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/1yw7aa/hey_reddit_want_to_help_curate_a_museum/).

# Types of GIFs

## Graphic

Original use for .gif file format. Used mostly for interfaces and 90s throwback nostalgia. 

## Photographic 

A GIF made with photo or video source material. Easiest to start with by importing video as layers and then 

## Alternating / Boomerang

## Cinemagraph

A gif, usually cinematic in appearnce, that only displays one moving item in frame. Can be lower file size than straight up video gifs as static pixels don't need to update each frame!

## "Wiggle"

# Photoshop

## Timeline (Animation) Window

Timeline vs Frame Animation option

## Frames, Keyframing, Layers

Frames: play in chronologic order and repeat. Frames can be set to have different durations.

Keyframing/Tweening:

Layers: static objects such as text should be at the very top. I recommend making two separate folders to keep photoshop document organized.

Adjustment Layers: can be added as well! The opacity and blending modes can be set in each individual frame.

## Frame Rates

[Null Sleep Frame Delay Browser](http://nullsleep.tumblr.com/post/16524517190/animated-gif-minimum-frame-delay-browser)

[Comparison Video](https://www.supercircuits.com/resources/tools/video-frame-rate-comparison-tool)

## Other "pre-production" ideas.

Edit video in After Effects, Premiere, Final Cut prior to importing as frame layers.

## Exporting Options

Color space, File Size

Quick class assignment: take a short video of yourself waving, trim video file optimally for smooth alternating motion, utilize masking to reduce file size. Optional (add other photoshop effects).

### Avoid Triggering GIFs

Since GIFs can only handle a small number of frames, [it's easy for a GIF to rely on quick visual changes](http://www.ibtimes.com/animated-gifs-epilepsy-dangers-849817) that may not be suitable for all students/viewers. [Smoother motion can also be more comfortable](http://trickstersgambit.tumblr.com/post/24875127375/epilepsy-warning-tags-and-how-to-use-them-a-guide) to watch for extended periods of time. 

A free tool called [P.E.A.T.](http://trace.umd.edu/peat) (Photosensitive Epilepsy Analysis Tool) can be used to asses if a GIF or Video will be triggering to a viewer.
