# GIFs, what even are they

## Technical Specs

A .gif file is used for bitmap images (or images built around pixels). While this file type has a significantly smaller color space, it supports animation which draws the most appeal for its use. [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF)]

* Why would we want to use them?
  * Beginning origins on the internet
  
## Reaction GIFs

A lot of messaging apps and digital communication involes *reaction GIFs*. They can be interpretted [a stand in for body language](https://daily.jstor.org/the-morphology-of-reaction-gifs/) that could drastically change the way a message is received. There is still a very constant and face paced way that this format of communicating is evolving, but [some museums are doing their best to put them into a historical context](https://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/1yw7aa/hey_reddit_want_to_help_curate_a_museum/).

### Avoid Triggering GIFs

Since GIFs can only handle a small number of frames, [it's easy for a GIF to rely on quick visual changes](http://www.ibtimes.com/animated-gifs-epilepsy-dangers-849817) that may not be suitable for all students/viewers. [Smoother motion can also be more comfortable](http://trickstersgambit.tumblr.com/post/24875127375/epilepsy-warning-tags-and-how-to-use-them-a-guide) to watch for extended periods of time. 

A free tool called [P.E.A.T.](http://trace.umd.edu/peat) (Photosensitive Epilepsy Analysis Tool) can be used to asses if a GIF or Video will be triggering to a viewer.
